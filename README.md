# Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and utilizing the project. It contains detailed information about the project's purpose, functionality, and implementation.

# Introduction
Welcome to this documentation, which aims to get you familiarize with this shopping app.

# User
This is a README file for an E-commerce Flutter application developed using the Provider package for efficient state management, reliable support, and compatibility. The application leverages Firebase real-time database services for data storage, retrieval, and CRUD operations on user-owned products. Several features have been implemented to enhance the user experience, including user authentication, cart and order management, favorites curation, and automatic login with animations and transitions.

# Features
The E-commerce Flutter application offers the following features:

# User Authentication:
Users can create an account, log in, and log out securely. This feature ensures that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application, such as managing their cart or placing orders or creating/deleting/updating the details of their own products.

# Cart Management:
Users can add products to their cart, view the items in the cart, update quantities, and remove items. The cart provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to keep track of the products they intend to purchase.

# Order Management:
Users can place orders for the products in their cart. Once an order is placed, it is processed and stored in the Firebase real-time database. Users can view their order history and track the status of their orders.

# Favorites Curation:
Users can mark products as favorites, allowing them to easily access and revisit products of interest.

# Automatic Login:
If a user has previously logged in and the session is still valid, the application automatically logs in the user upon launching the app.

# Technologies Used
The E-commerce Flutter application utilizes the following technologies and packages:

# Provider:
A package for state management in Flutter that allows efficient and scalable management of application state across widgets.

# Firebase Real-time Database:
A cloud-hosted NoSQL database provided by Firebase, which enables real-time synchronization and data persistence for applications.
